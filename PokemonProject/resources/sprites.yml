# The Syntax of sprite Data for PokemonProject
#
# *         = Required
# '         = Partly required, means that the variable is needed if another variable don't exist
# [ Value ] = Default value when optional
#
#*(name):                                        = [ str] The access name for this sprite
#  *filename:                                    = [ str] The filename for the resource
#   path: [ /resources/image/ ]                  = [ str] The filepath to the resource
#   xOffset: [ 0 ]                               = [ int] Sets the horizontal offset for the whole sprite, it will only import a part of the image if this is defined, in pixels
#   yOffset: [ 0 ]                               = [ int] Sets the vertical offset for the whole sprite, it will only import a part of the image if this is defined, in pixels
#   spriteSheet:                                 = [void] Makes the image to a spritesheet. 
#    'imageWidth:       or width/imageXCount     = [ int] Width of the images in the spritesheet in pixels
#    'imageHeight:       or height/imageYCount   = [ int] Height o the images in the spritesheet in pixels
#    'imageXCount:       or imageWidth           = [ int] Number of images horizontally in the spritesheet
#    'imageYCount:       or imageHeight          = [ int] Number of images vertically in the spritesheet
#     spacing: [ 0 ]                             = [ int] 
#     imageCount :                               = [ int] 
#     animation:                                 = [void] Makes the image to a animation
#       animationSpeed: [ 100 ]                  = [ int]/[list] 
#       loop: [ true ]                           = [bool] 
#       pingpong: [ false ]                      = [bool] 
#       imagesInGroup: [ false ]                 = [ int]/[bool] Splits the animation, integer for selecting how many images per animation, when "true": uses a horizontal row instead
#
# Accessing sprites:
#   There are four different containers. When you want to access a sprite,
#   it depends on which variables you defined.
#     Sprite.getAnimationGroup(String name) : 
#     Sprite.getAnimation(String name)      : If "animation: " in "spriteSheet: " is defined and it is both a spritesheet and a animation
#     Sprite.getImageGroup(String name)     : If "spriteSheet: " is defined and it's only a spritesheet
#     Sprite.getImage(String name)          : When none of the variables above are defined, then it will be put in to the image section
